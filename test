An important reason why a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to reveal the testing result to relevant third party is
thatit would help early detection of genetic diseases within the family members. This would then lead to necessary treatment to save 
lives. In the case of breast cancer, recent studies show that women who suffer from breast cancer would have an increased likelihood of a sister to get the same disease (EverythingAboutBreastCancer, 2009). American Cancer Society (2005) also reveals that 5%-10% of the breast cancer patients inherit the mutated genes of BRCA1 and BRCA2 from their first degree relatives. Since there is no symptom of such disease in the early and most treatable stage, revealing of testing result by the carrier would alert the relevant third party to undergo similar 
testing and receive necessary treatments if it is a positive result. Some may argue that third party should have done regular check
 up to monitor personal health condition instead of starting to do so when there is a carrier in the family. However, self-examine 
has low accuracy in detection of breast cancer while other method like mammography is only meant for women who age 40 years old and 
above (georgiahealthinfo.gov, n.d.). This might be relatively inefficient in term of early detection of the disease as female at
 young age would also be exposed to the risk of getting breast cancer.
